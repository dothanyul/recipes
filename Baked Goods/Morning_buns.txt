Place 2 1/4 lb flour, 21 1/2 oz whole milk, 3/4 oz salt, 1/2 oz yeast, 1/4 oz 
malt powder, and 1 1/2 oz butter in the bowl of an electric mixer with a hook 
attachment. Mix on the lowest speed for approx. 2-3 minutes until the dough 
just comes together. Add the sugar and mix on second speed for another 3-4 
minutes. The dough will still look a bit shaggy and underdeveloped. Place dough
in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8-15 hours before rolling in.

Right before butter lamination: Cut 21 oz COLD butter into cubes. Pound the cubes 
with a rolling pin until they come together in a single cohesive mass. You want
the butter mass to be the same consistency as the dough. The goal is to make 
the stiff, cold butter pliable without warming it. Mold the butter into a 
rectangle around 9" x 6".

Laminate the butter into the dough using three single folds, resting the dough 
in the refrigerator 30 minutes before each turn. The finished book can then be 
wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for 1-2 hours before pulling out for final 
shaping or it can be frozen for later use. **This process is best viewed online
as a video. There is also a well written procedure for this with pictures in 
the baking book "TARTINE BREAD".

Roll the croissant dough block into a rectangle approximately 7" wide and about
1/4" thick. Sprinkle water over the surface of the entire rectangle and spread 
it evenly over the surface with your hand. Combine 3 c brown sugar and 3 1/2 
tbsp cinnamon and spread this mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a gap of about 1" along 
the long edge at the top. Roll the dough like a cinnamon roll from the long 
bottom edge to the top, keeping the log fairly tight. Cut the log into 35 even 
pieces and place each piece in a small muffin tin that has been generously 
coated with pan spray. Proof at room temperature for approx. 2 hours. Bake at 
375Â° for approx. 12 minutes. As soon as these come out of the oven, turn them 
out of the muffin pans onto a cooling rack or a sheet of parchment. Let cool 
and roll in sugar.
