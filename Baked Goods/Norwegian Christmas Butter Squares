Preheat oven to 400 F. Chill an ungreased 9"x13" baking pan in the freezer.

Blend 1 c butter, 1 egg, 1 c sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt together until creamy. 
Add 2 c flour and 1 tsp vanilla and mix with your hands until the mixture holds
together in large clumps. If it seems overly soft, add a little extra flour.

Using your hands, press the dough out onto the chilled pan until it is even and
1/4" thick. Dust the top evenly with turbinado sugar.

Bake at 400 F about 12-15 minutes, until the edges turn a golden brown. Let 
cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into squares and removing from the warm
pan using a spatula.


Ingredients:
1 c unsalted butter, softened
1 egg
1 c granulated sugar
2 c all-purpose flour
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
Turbinado sugar for dusting
