Whisk 2 eggs with enough water to make 2 c total. Add 2 tbsp white sugar and 1 
tbsp yeast, and let sit until bubbly, 5-10 minutes. Add 2 tbsp butter or oil, 
2 c whole wheat flour, and 2-3 tbsp salt and mix well, then add 3 c white flour
and mix until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a floured 
board and, using more flour as needed, knead about 3-4 minutes until smooth. 
Let it rest for a few minutes while you clean and grease the bowl, then knead 
again until no longer sticky, about 5 minutes. Put in the greased bowl, cover, 
and let rise until it no longer rises back when you poke it, 1 1/2-2 hours.

Punch the dough down and roll into a rectangle 1' x 2', 1/4"-1/2" thick. Spread
with 4 oz cream cheese and 1 1/4 c jelly. Spread the filling all the way to 
three edges, leaving 1/2"-1" bare on one of the long edges. Roll up from the 
filled long edge to yield a 2' roll, like a jelly roll. Pinch the long 
unbuttered edge closed. Spread the remaining 1 oz butter, and 1/4 c jelly) in 
the bottom of a 9"x13" pan. Cut the roll into 12-15 pieces. Place the rolls in 
the pan and squish them a little to spread them out, then leave to rise for an 
hour OR put into the fridge to rise overnight!

Place the pan in a cold oven and set it to 375 F for 15 minutes (they will rise
a bit more). Then turn the oven down to 350 F for another 20-30 minutes; if you
smell browning sugar, turn it down to 325 F. To check if they're done, remove 
from the oven and pull up a middle roll. It should break in the middle and show
if it's doughy or baked through. 

Remove from the oven and invert onto a platter. Use a rubber spatula to remove 
and redistribute any filling that gets left behind.
