Preheat oven to 350 F. 

Mix 4 c mochiko, 3 c sugar, and 1 tbsp baking powder together in a 9" x 13" 
pan.

Melt 4 oz butter in a large bowl. Add 3 c cow milk and 12 oz coconut milk; if
the butter cools and precipitates, heat the whole mixture until it melts again.
Add 5 eggs and beat well.

Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry. Mix it with your fingers, making sure
to smooth out the lumps as you go.

Bake for 1 hour, then turn the oven off and leave it in for another 19 minutes.
Serve warm or at room temperature; it will keep for a couple days before it 
starts to dry out.
