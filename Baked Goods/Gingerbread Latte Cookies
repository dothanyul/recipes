Melt 3/4 c butter in a medium saucepan over medium. When it begins to bubble 
and get foamy, remove from the heat and whisk in 1/4 c espresso powder, 1 tbsp 
grated fresh ginger, 2 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 
1/4 tsp cloves. Scrape the butter mixture into a medium mixing bowl and set 
aside to cool for about 5 minutes.

Add 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c molasses, and 1 tsp salt to 
the bowl and whisk vigorously to combine. Add 1 egg, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp 
baking soda and continue whisking until the mixture appears smooth and is the 
consistency of thin pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups flour and mix 
until evenly incorporated. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours and 
up to 2 days before baking.

Heat oven to 375 degrees, with racks on the lower and upper thirds. Prepare 
the coating by combining 1/4 c white sugar, 2 tsp espresso powder, and 1/2 tsp 
ground ginger in a small bowl.

Roll the dough into 1-oz balls - about the size of a walnut. Toss in the sugar 
mixture to coat. Bake them, 2 inches apart, rotating the sheets on the racks 
halfway through, until the cookies have spread slightly and appear craggy on 
the surface, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheets for 3 
minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. (The cookies will 
flatten once cooled.) These cookies keep in an airtight container at room 
temperature for 4 to 5 days (if they last that long).

Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
