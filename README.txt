Digital recipe box which I will maybe try to make a hard copy of someday, so if
this computer dies I don't lose it again.

Formatting: Lines shouldn't exceed 80 columns in width. This is an old outdated
standard but it has the advantage of making it a little easier to read, and if 
I put it in split-screen mode it doesn't overflow. 

There are two sections: instructions, which is unlabeled, and ingredients, 
which is labeled "Ingredients:". They are separated by two blank lines.

Instructions should be left-justified (not indented) paragraphs, wrapped at 80
characters, separated by a blank line. Any ingredients listed inline should
include the measurement (e.g. "Add 1 1/2 c white flour and mix until just
combined"), so I don't have to go looking for the measurement in the list of 
ingredients. However, the ingredient name should only be specific enough to 
distinguish it from the other ingredients (e.g., you might have white flour and
whole-wheat flour, in which case you would say such in the instructions, but if 
there was only white flour, say white flour in the ingredients but just flour 
in the instructions). Baked goods, at least, should have an account of how many
it makes somewhere (probably at the last line of the instructions).  

Ingredients are left-justified but wrapped lines use a hanging indent, because 
lines aren't separated by blank lines (because most ingredients won't wrap). 
In contrast to the instructions, the ingredient names should dismbiguate from 
all possible ingredients (within reason). If there's only one kind of flour, 
say what kind of flour it is. Try to limit the degree of pre-processing in the 
ingredients (e.g., don't call for "3 cloves garlic, minced"; rather, in the 
instructions, say to mince the garlic when it comes time to do so. However, 
more than other things, this will be a judgment call, because it's a strong
convention in recipe writing, and probably for a good reason. If a recipe needs
an ingredient in two places (e.g. cookies with sugar in the dough and the 
glaze), list it combined; this is one advantage of always putting the 
measurements in the instructions. (If the recipe uses two different units for
two different measurements of the same unit, don't combine them, and list them 
in order of appearance, e.g. "4 1/2 oz + 1 c sugar" for the dough and for 
rolling, respectively.
