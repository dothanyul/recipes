Whisk together 3 eggs and 1 1/2 c milk. Gently heat the mixture to around 90 F. 
Melt 2 tbsp butter and whisk into the eggs and milk. Sift 1 c flour into the 
mixture, add 2 tsp salt, and mix thoroughly.

Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in around 1/4 c 
of batter and swirl it to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, 
then flip, and cook for another minute on the reverse side. Repeat for the rest
of the batter (no need to add more oil unless they start to stick). 

Makes about a dozen crepes.
