In a large bowl, whisk together 5 eggs, 1 1/2 c milk, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2
tbsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ground ginger, 3 ground cloves, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Slice 
6 slices of bread into rough 1" dice, mix into the egg mixture, and let sit for
at least 15 minutes.

Put a 9" square pan in the oven and heat to 350 F. When it's hot, take the pan 
out and grease it with 1/2 oz butter. Stir the bread mixture once to 
re-incorporate, and pour it into the greased pan. Bake for 20 minutes.

While it bakes, make the caramel sauce: Melt 2 oz butter over medium heat. When
it's melted, add 1 c white sugar and (roughly) 1/2 c milk (a little at a time
to adjust the thickness). When it becomes a thin caramel sauce, turn it off and
wait until the pudding is done; take the pudding out, pour the sauce evenly 
over the top, and put it back in for another 10-15 minutes, until the middle is
no longer soupy.
