Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, and saute 1 chopped 
onion until softened. Add 1 medium diced sweet potato and saute for 5 minutes.
Add 1 tbsp minced ginger and 2 cloves minced garlic; stir and reduce heat to 
low.

Finely dice 1 hot chili, keeping the seeds if you want more heat. Add chili, 1
c lentils, 2 tsp coriander, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp ground 
ginger to the pan, and stir until lentils are well coated with oil. Add 1 c 
canned chopped tomatoes and 4 c water. Raise heat to bring to a boil, then 
reduce heat until mixture is at a fast simmer. Cook uncovered until lentils 
and sweet potatoes are soft, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.

Season to taste with salt and continue to simmer until mixture has thickened, 
about 10 minutes. Whisk to amalgamate lentils and sweet potatoes. If the dal is
too soupy, increase heat and cook a little longer. 

To serve, transfer to a serving bowl and top with 2 tbsp chopped cilatro and 
freshly shaved or dried flaked coconut, if desired.
