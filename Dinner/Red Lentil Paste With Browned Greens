Put 1 1/2 c red lentils in a pot and add enough water to cover them, plus about
an inch. Add 2 tsp salt, cover, and bring to a boil. When the lentils boil, 
turn them down to a simmer and add 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp
paprika, 2 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp MSG, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp 
tarragon, and 1/2 tsp fennel. Continue stirring as the water boils away.

Heat 2 tbsp oil over medium-low heat. Dice 1 large onion and fry in the oil 
with 1/2 tsp salt. If the pan gets too hot and they start to turn black, pour 
in a splash of water and stir to cool the pan and dissolve and redistribute the
cooked sugars. Continue to fry until they start to disintegrate into a brown 
paste. When the onions are completely caramelized, stir them into the lentils.

While the onions cook, cook the greens: Heat 3 tbsp oil over medium-high heat.
Cut the central veins out of 6-10 large leaves of kale or collard greens, slice
the veins thin, and fry them until they turn soft and bright green, 3-5 
minutes. While they cook, slice the leaves thin (I like to do skinny rhombi).
Once the veins are a little cooked, stir in the leaves. Stir and fry for about
5 minutes, then mince and add 5 cloves of garlic and 1 tbsp butter and fry for 
another 5-10 minutes. These can be good cooked lightly or heavily, so up to 
even 30 minutes might be preferable.

When the lentils thicken and start to fall apart, mix in 1/4 c olive oil. 
Continue to cook the lentils until they're stiff enough to almost form peaks.
Serve the lentils with the greens over rice.
