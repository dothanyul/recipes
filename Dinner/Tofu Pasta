Put a pot of water on to boil with 1 tbsp salt and 1 tbsp olive oil. Crumble 
the tofu into small pieces, as small as you can by hand, and mix in 1 tbsp soy
sauce. Put 3 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil in a medium-small pan and add the
tofu. Stir and fry until the butter is browned and the tofu is brown and 
crispy, about 20 minutes.

While the tofu cooks, in a medium bowl, press 5 cloves pickled garlic. Grind 1 
tbsp dried basil, 2 tsp dried rosemary, and 2 tsp dried oregano together, add 1
tbsp onion powder and 1 tsp ground coriander, and add to the garlic. Add 1 tbsp
salt and 2-3 tbsp mushroom bouillon powder, mix together, and wet to a slurry 
with veggie stock. 

When the water boils, add 1 lb pasta. Then, while the pasta and tofu cook, melt
2 tbsp butter in a saucepan with a splash of milk. Once the butter is melted, 
add 3 tbsp white flour and mix well. Before the mixture gets too clumpy, add 
another splash of milk and mix well; continue thinning the flour with milk 
until it no longer clumps and is a little thicker than heavy cream. Add 1/4 c 
grated cheddar and 1/4 c grated Romano and mix until the cheeses have melted; 
thin with a little more milk if it gets too thick. 

When the tofu is cooked, pour it in the spices with all the butter and mix 
well, then mix in the sauce. When the pasta is cooked, drain it and serve with
the sauce.
