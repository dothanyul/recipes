Dice 1 onion. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large pot and add the onion. Add 1 tsp rice 
vinegar and 2 tsp salt and saute. While the onion cooks, cut 12-16 oz squash 
into 1/2" dice. Once the onion is well browned, add 1 tbsp oil and the squash 
and mix well. 

Once the squash is soft, add 1 tbsp oil and 1 1/2 c rice, mix to coat the rice
with oil, and add enough stock to cover. Cover and let simmer.

Combine zest and juice of 1 lemon, juice of 1 lime, 1 thumb grated ginger, 6 
cloves chopped garlic, 2 tsp ground coriander, 2 tsp ground fenugreek, and 1 
tsp ground dried rosemary. Chop 3-6 leaves of chard into short ribbons. Once 
the liquid in the pot has gone down, add the chard and 1 tbsp salt to the pot, 
cover with more stock, and let simmer. Continue adding more stock as it soaks 
into the rice.

Once the rice is almost cooked, add the acid mixture and a little more stock. 
Adjust seasonings to taste and Cook until the rice is done and the flavors 
become friendly.
